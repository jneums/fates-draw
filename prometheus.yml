  why_this_app: Getting true, verifiable randomness on a deterministic platform like the blockchain is hard. The Fates' Draw solves this by providing a simple, powerful API backed by the IC's native cryptographic entropy. It eliminates the need for complex, off-chain solutions, allowing you to build secure, unpredictable applications with confidence.
  key_features:
    - "Cryptographically Secure: Leverages the Internet Computer's native system-level entropy."
    - "Fully On-Chain & Verifiable: No off-chain components or trusted third parties required."
    - "Developer-Friendly API: A simple tool call to request a specific number of random bytes."
    - "Flexible & Performant: Designed for low-latency responses for on-chain applications."
