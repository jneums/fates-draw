  why_this_app: Verifiable randomness on the blockchain is a hard problem. The Fates' Draw solves it by exposing the IC's native entropy through a simple, on-chain API. Build secure, unpredictable apps without complex, off-chain solutions.
  key_features:
    - "Cryptographically Secure: Leverages the Internet Computer's native, system-level entropy."
    - "Fully On-Chain & Verifiable: No off-chain components or trusted third parties required."
    - "Dual-Function API: Get low-level random bytes (`draw_randomness`) or a simple, fair coin toss (`coinflip`)."
    - "Built for dApps & Gaming: A reliable source of truth for NFT mints, in-game events, and secure protocols."
